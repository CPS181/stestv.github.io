1. Log into Github (sign up if you don't have one).
2. Create a new repo and name it using the following pattern
  replacewithyourusername.github.io
[!!!!Github will not host your website unless you use this naming convention!!!!]
Make sure to initalize repo with a readme file!!! [Check the box]
3. Simplest approach is to upload file via the repo's page. Just hit the 'Upload Button'
4. Your page's address will follow the naming convention of the repo.
   Just type into browser's address bar: replacewithyourusername.github.io
